# hfts_grasp_planner
A ROS-integrated implementation of the HFTS fingertip grasp planner.

## How to run
This repository contains two relevant ROS nodes: *hfts_integrated_planner_node* and *hfts_planner_node*.
The *hfts_integrated_planner_node* provides an integrated grasp and motion planning algorithm
whereas the *hfts_planner_node* provides only a grasp planning algorithm.
For both nodes there are launch files available.
